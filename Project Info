Project Motivation:
Due to the high increase in the prices of mobile phones, we will be taking a deep dive in the strategy companies follow to price mobile phone.
additionally, we will be investigating if these phones are worth the price based on the features they provide. Finally, and as our main goal we will be
analyzing and classifing how certain features affect the price.
